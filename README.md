# MeaningOfScience

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

If there is a problem already researched well enough, published and peer reviewed, there should be a practical use for it. This project is for finding a multidisciplinar solution to various problems what haven't been solved because of the compartmentalization of the well researched scienctific fields.


## Background

Most of the scientific researches has been done in an isolated way, excluded other connected fields, concentrating only for their narrowed scope. This is a pretty normal way of working considering the depth of knowledge and details included in order to conduct them properly. Therefore the findings of the sole publications could be immensely meaningful as they are. Their purpose is to explore, describe or explain the world we live in. As we technologically ready to process and manipulate with big data via AI, there is an opportunity to contribute to this respectful aspriation of understanding. The initial assumption is, there is at least as much value within the nodes (as sole findings of a very specific are of science) as in the interconnectedness of them.

## How is it used?

TBD

## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources:
Many publications can be found online. Even the historical ones, where a holistic outcome has been formed based on sole researches. These can be used as the training data. On the other hand the much larger database of the recently "unprocessed" results could provide enough data to this initiative for future use.

## Challenges

Whatever the outcome will be from any field, it will be a still a theory which needs to be reviewed and put under the same process like any other publication. The used researches should match a list of pre-requisits in order to use it by this model.

## What next?

If this model is proven sufficient enough by the given scientific communities and/or has significant amount of practical realization, it should be put under development by broader teams(s) and included in the official scientific method as an augmentation of human efforts to describe, explain and understand the world.
